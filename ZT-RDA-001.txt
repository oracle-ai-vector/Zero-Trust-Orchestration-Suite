║   Zero Trust Incident Response Orchestration Engine    ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

# 1. Context & Scope
Defines a Zero Trust–aligned incident response orchestration engine with automated, controlled attack simulation for validation, measurement, and continuous improvement of detection, response, and policy enforcement across identity, endpoint, network, and cloud layers. Scope: Simulation and orchestration in isolated, staging, or CAB‑approved production segments. No real data exposure; synthetic/anonymized test data only. Alignment: NIST SP 800‑207 (Zero Trust), ISO/IEC 27035:2023 (incident management), GDPR Art. 33 timelines, PCI‑DSS 12.10 IR testing cadence, SOX 404 change control.

# 2. Objective
Design and run safe, measurable adversary emulations mapped to MITRE ATT&CK to: validate Zero Trust controls, measure detection coverage (MTTD/MTTR), exercise SOAR playbooks, and produce audit‑ready compliance documentation.

# 3. Input Specifications
- attack_scenario: 'ransomware_lateral_movement'
- mitre_attack_techniques: ['T1078','T1548','T1021.002','T1486']
- target_assets: ordered array of asset identifiers (e.g., ['workstation-dev-01', 'fileserver-corp-03', 'domain-controller-01'])
- aggressiveness_level: enum ['stealthy','balanced','noisy']
- environment: enum ['isolated_test','staging','production' (CAB‑approved)]
- security_telemetry_sources: { SIEM, EDR, NDR, IAM, CSPM endpoints + tokens }
- zero_trust_architecture_config: { IdP endpoint, PEP list, PDP endpoint, microsegmentation_rules }
- compliance_requirements: array ['NIST SP 800‑207','GDPR Art.33','PCI‑DSS 12.10','SOX 404']

# 4. Constraints & Guardrails
- Ethical: No disruption to business-critical services. Use synthetic data only.
- Regulatory: Enforce continuous auth, least privilege, and micro-segmentation. Log timestamps for GDPR.
- Technical: False Positives <5%. Simulation traffic ≤10% of baseline. Automated actions reversible within 60s.
- Operational: CAB approval for prod. Debrief within 5 business days.

# 5. Reasoning Framework
- 5.1 Pre-Simulation Validation: Validate all inputs, test ZTA component connectivity, and establish baseline telemetry.
- 5.2 Attack Simulation Execution: Deploy adversary emulation using Caldera/Atomic Red Team modules. Execute multi-stage attack: T1078 (Initial Access) -> T1548 (Privilege Escalation) -> T1021.002 (Lateral Movement) -> T1486 (Impact - SIMULATED encryption only).
- 5.3 Automated Incident Response Orchestration: Ingest alerts into SOAR. Execute automated playbooks (e.g., isolate_endpoint, revoke_credentials, update_zt_policy). Require human approval for high-impact actions. Track MTTR.
- 5.4 Zero Trust Maturity Scoring: Quantify maturity based on detection coverage, response automation, policy enforcement, and MTTD/MTTR performance.
- 5.5 Compliance Documentation Generation: Produce audit-ready reports for GDPR, PCI-DSS, and SOX.
- 5.6 Final Output Assembly: Compile all results into a single JSON object with an executive dashboard and a prioritized remediation roadmap.

# 6. Output Format & Validation
Produce a single, comprehensive JSON object as specified in the detailed schema, including metadata, timelines, maturity scores, gap analysis, and compliance documentation links. Validate against schema rules.

# 7. Failure Mode Handling
- ZTA_COMPONENT_FAILURE: Abort simulation if critical Zero Trust components are unavailable.
- LOW_DETECTION_COVERAGE: Issue a warning and recommend tuning if detection coverage is below 60%.

# 9. Notes & Assumptions
All simulations use synthetic data. Approvals are mandatory for production environments.
